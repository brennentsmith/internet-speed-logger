# Internet Speed Logger

_An application to track your internet download and upload speeds with an elegant web interface._

![Preview of Internet Speed Logger](https://i.imgur.com/LhtHxpZ.gif)

This is a time series based application which continuously monitors your internet connection and plots the results within a responsive web view along with providing basic aggregation of the current visible timeframe (mean). This leverages the [official Speedtest.net CLI binary](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) from Ookla to provide the best performance possible.

An early version of this service has been running for many years (~2016) and it has been instrumental for tracking internet performance issues.

To bring it online, simply run:
```
git clone https://github.com/brennentsmith/internet-speed-logger.git
cd internet-speed-logger
docker-compose up
```
Wait a couple minutes for MongoDB to initialize, and then go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser, and away you go!

In case you see errors from mongodb with:<br />
`mongodb | mkdir: cannot create directory '/bitnami/mongodb': Permission denied`<br />
`mongodb exited with code 1`

Try to set the persistent data directory rights:
```
docker-compose down
sudo chown -R 1001 mongo-persistence/
docker-compose up
```

## Updating
To get the latest Docker image, run:
```
docker-compose stop
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up
```

## Components

The requrements for Internet Speed Logger are:
- NodeJS 12-LTS or newer
- MongoDB

There are three core components to running Internet Speed Logger:
- Webserver (`/index.js`) - Webserver which delivers static assets and provides API. 
- Speedrunner (`/run-speedtest.js`) - Daemon or One Shot process which performs the internet speed test.
- MongoDB - "Web Scale" persistence layer. ðŸ˜œ

The Webserver and MongoDB must always be running, however the Speedrunner can be either run as a daemon `/run-speedtest.js daemon` or invoked via cron or SystemD timer as a oneshot process `/run-speedtest.js`. Both the Webserver and Speedrunner share the common config within `/config/default.js`.

## Configuration

All configuration is held within the `/config/default.js` directory. The following options are available:

| Leaf | Default | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `webserver.listenPort`      | `3000`       | Port which the webserver will listen on   |
| `webserver.listenHost`      | `0.0.0.0`       | Host which the webserver will listen on   |
| `db.connectionString`   | `mongodb://speedtest:speedtest@mongo:27017/speedtest`        | Connection string the connection for the backend MongoDB compliant database. See: [Connection String URI Format](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/)      |
| `db.collection`      | `speedtest`       | Collection to use within MongoDB compliant database.   |
| `speedtest.commandString`      | `bin/speedtest -f json --accept-license`       | Raw command to execute to perform speed test. Change this if you want it on a different path or specify a specific server.   |
| `speedtest.intervalSec`      | `43200`       | Interval for which the speedtest will be run. This will be randomly skewed +/- 25% and limited to no less than 1800 (30 minutes) seconds between runs.   |
| `speedtest.serverId` |  | Specify a specific server to use for each test. You can get nearest servers with `-L` when running the binary manually |

## Running Internet Speed Logger

### Container
A container is published to [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/brennentsmith/internet-speed-logger) which contains both the webserver and test daemon.

```
git clone https://github.com/brennentsmith/internet-speed-logger.git
cd internet-speed-logger
docker compose up
```
In case you see errors from mongodb with:<br />
`mongodb | mkdir: cannot create directory '/bitnami/mongodb': Permission denied`<br />
`mongodb exited with code 1`

Try to set the persistent data directory rights:
```
docker-compose down
sudo chown -R 1001 mongo-persistence/
docker-compose up
```

You may see some errors upon boot regarding `speedlogger-web_1     | MongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server` - these are normal as the web service will attempt to create the connection pool before MongoDB is ready. Once MongoDB is ready (~30s), all will work correctly. 

### Forever
Install the following:
- NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ 
- MongoDB: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
- Forever: https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever (optional) 

```
git clone https://github.com/brennentsmith/internet-speed-logger.git
cd internet-speed-logger
<< download latest version of Speedtest-CLI binary to `bin` dir within repo >>
npm ci
forever start index.js
forever start run-speedtest.js daemon
```
